This bug occurs when using the Expo ImagePicker library on Android.  After selecting an image, the app crashes with a `TypeError: null is not an object (evaluating 'RNFS.stat')` error. This happens inconsistently, sometimes working fine, and other times crashing immediately after image selection. The error points to a problem with the `RNFS` library, but the issue appears to stem from how Expo ImagePicker interacts with it on Android.
